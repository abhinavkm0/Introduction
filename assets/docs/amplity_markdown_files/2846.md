**Global Large BioPharma**  
![Globe](https://cdn.bfldr.com/QO5XXLW2/at/76q33jwqsbsj3rtztgpb5v78/Globe.jpg?format=png&crop=3038%2C2497%2Cx38%2Cy51&width=471&height=387)

**Objectives:**  
- **Boost Patient Enrollment**  
  One year into a three-year trial, enroll the remaining 80% of patients.  
- **Engage Sites**  
  Sites were disengaged due to multiple, uncoordinated communications from diverse stakeholders.  
- **Improve Brand Image**  
  Ensure site personnel view the company favorably to foster long-term collaboration with researchers.

### The Approach  

#### Tools  
**Clinical Trial Liaison**  
![Site Relationship Experts](https://cdn.bfldr.com/QO5XXLW2/at/xp4n9tjrg3q4wj7296f25/site-relationship-experts.jpeg?format=png&crop=4671%2C3838%2Cx842%2Cy0&width=471&height=387)

**Strategies:**  
1. **Use Strong Communicators**  
   Lead a team of site relationship experts who are helpful to sites and build trust.  
2. **Take A Site-Centric Approach**  
   Put the site at the center of communication efforts. Build collaboration among the site, the client’s medical affairs team, the on-site study coordinator, the client’s study team, and the site research team.  
3. **Gauge Sites’ Likelihood To Contribute**  
   Collect deep insights about each site so that the client can invest the greatest resources in sites most likely to bring patients into the trial.
